# Welcome to Dustin's Homepage! 

I am an ambitious person trying to learn as much as I can about coding to prepare me for a career in the field. Please feel free to take a look at [my projects](https://github.com/DustinHall?tab=projects).
## Growth Mindset 

To me having a growth mindset is about keeping an open mind when faced with unanticipated difficulties and recognizing when its best to step back and take a break in order to keep a project moving forward. Having a growth mindest is understanding that anything worth doing takes work, and nothing goes as planned, while learning and ultimately trying to better, and get better from, every situation that comes up. A famous Henry Ford quote comes to mind:
> Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.
